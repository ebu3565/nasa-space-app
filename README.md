﻿# Sustainable Planet: Building Healthier Cities Together

## Demonstrative Working Prototype in Website:

[www](http://www.clouddrone.top/)

## Documentation:

The web application integrates **multi-source urban datasets** (satellite imagery, IoT sensors, waste statistics, and flood forecasts) into a unified GIS platform for sustainable city planning. Planners can upload, analyze, and visualize data in real-time to support climate-resilient urban development.

---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

1. **Collect multi-source datasets** including:

   * NASA Earth Observation (EO) data.
   * IoT smart bin data and drone imagery.
   * Flood forecasts and climate risk models.
   * City waste and population growth statistics.

2. **Clean, filter, and standardize** datasets to remove noise, ensure data quality, and harmonize different formats.

3. **Integrate diverse formats** (satellite, sensor, survey, GIS layers) into a **unified geospatial database** for advanced urban analysis.

---

### Step 2: Analyzing and Correlating Data

1. Apply **analytical and AI models** to detect waste hotspots, urban growth patterns, and environmental risks.
2. Correlate **urban growth trends** with **climate resilience indicators** (soil moisture, air quality, plastic waste accumulation, flood risk).
3. Use **GIS + AI-based spatial mapping** to visualize hotspots, vulnerable zones, and future risk projections.

---

### Step 3: Decision Support & Insights for Urban Planners

1. **Generate interactive dashboards** with real-time data and insights for policymakers.
2. Provide **scenario-based simulations**, e.g.:

   * Flood forecast + unmanaged waste impact on public health.
   * Rapid population growth + waste system strain.
3. Recommend **sustainable interventions**, including:

   * Optimized waste collection routes.
   * Zero-waste city planning models.
   * Plastic recycling and circular economy strategies.

---

### Step 4: Web-Based GIS Visualization

1. Deploy final maps and dashboards on a **web-based GIS platform** for accessibility.
2. Ensure **interactive and real-time visualizations** for waste management, climate resilience, and sustainability planning.

Methodology – Sustainable Planet Web Application

Data Preprocessing

Collect multi-source datasets (NASA Earth Observation data, IoT smart bin data, drone imagery, flood forecasts, population growth, and city waste statistics).

Clean, filter, and standardize the data to remove noise and ensure quality.

Integrate different formats (satellite data, sensor data, survey reports, GIS layers) into a unified database for urban analysis.

Analyzing and Correlating Data

Apply analytical models to identify patterns between waste hotspots, population density, flood-prone zones, and environmental risks.

Correlate urban growth trends with climate resilience indicators such as soil moisture, air quality, and plastic waste accumulation.

Use spatial mapping (GIS + AI) to visualize risk zones and support evidence-based urban planning.

Decision Support & Insights for Urban Planners

Generate dashboards with real-time insights for urban planners and policymakers.

Provide scenario-based simulations (e.g., flood forecast + waste pile-up impact on health).

Recommend sustainable interventions like optimized waste collection routes, zero-waste city models, and plastic recycling strategies.

Enable planners to design healthier, climate-resilient, and future-ready cities.

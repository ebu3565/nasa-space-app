## Documentation:

The web application integrates **multi-source urban datasets** (satellite imagery, IoT sensors, waste statistics, and flood forecasts) into a unified GIS platform for sustainable city planning. Planners can upload, analyze, and visualize data in real-time to support climate-resilient urban development.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

1. **Collect multi-source datasets** including:

   * NASA Earth Observation (EO) data.
   * IoT smart bin data and drone imagery.
   * Flood forecasts and climate risk models.
   * City waste and population growth statistics.

2. **Clean, filter, and standardize** datasets to remove noise, ensure data quality, and harmonize different formats.

3. **Integrate diverse formats** (satellite, sensor, survey, GIS layers) into a **unified geospatial database** for advanced urban analysis.

### Step 2: Analyzing and Correlating Data

1. Apply **analytical and AI models** to detect waste hotspots, urban growth patterns, and environmental risks.
2. Correlate **urban growth trends** with **climate resilience indicators** (soil moisture, air quality, plastic waste accumulation, flood risk).
3. Use **GIS + AI-based spatial mapping** to visualize hotspots, vulnerable zones, and future risk projections.

### Step 3: Decision Support & Insights for Urban Planners

1. **Generate interactive dashboards** with real-time data and insights for policymakers.
2. Provide **scenario-based simulations**, e.g.:

   * Flood forecast + unmanaged waste impact on public health.
   * Rapid population growth + waste system strain.
3. Recommend **sustainable interventions**, including:

   * Optimized waste collection routes.
   * Zero-waste city planning models.
   * Plastic recycling and circular economy strategies.

### Step 4: Web-Based GIS Visualization

1. Deploy final maps and dashboards on a **web-based GIS platform** for accessibility.
2. Ensure **interactive and real-time visualizations** for waste management, climate resilience, and sustainability planning.

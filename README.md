Methodology – Sustainable Planet Web Application

Data Preprocessing

Collect multi-source datasets (NASA Earth Observation data, IoT smart bin data, drone imagery, flood forecasts, population growth, and city waste statistics).

Clean, filter, and standardize the data to remove noise and ensure quality.

Integrate different formats (satellite data, sensor data, survey reports, GIS layers) into a unified database for urban analysis.

Analyzing and Correlating Data

Apply analytical models to identify patterns between waste hotspots, population density, flood-prone zones, and environmental risks.

Correlate urban growth trends with climate resilience indicators such as soil moisture, air quality, and plastic waste accumulation.

Use spatial mapping (GIS + AI) to visualize risk zones and support evidence-based urban planning.

Decision Support & Insights for Urban Planners

Generate dashboards with real-time insights for urban planners and policymakers.

Provide scenario-based simulations (e.g., flood forecast + waste pile-up impact on health).

Recommend sustainable interventions like optimized waste collection routes, zero-waste city models, and plastic recycling strategies.

Enable planners to design healthier, climate-resilient, and future-ready cities.
